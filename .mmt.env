# Unicorn is more than capable of spawning multiple workers, and in production

# set to 1.

# It becomes difficult to properly debug code if there's multiple copies of

# This is how we'll connect to PostgreSQL. It's good practice to keep the
# username lined up with your application's name but it's not necessary.
#
# Since we're dealing with development mode, it's ok to have a weak password
# such as `yourpassword` but in production you'll definitely want a better one.
#
# Eventually we'll be running everything in Docker containers, and you can set
# the host to be equal to `postgres` thanks to how Docker allows you to link
# containers.
#
# Everything else is standard Rails configuration for a PostgreSQL database.

# Both of these values are using the same Redis address but in a real
